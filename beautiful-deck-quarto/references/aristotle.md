# Aristotle for Academic Decks

## Ethos, Pathos, and Logos in Classrooms and Research Seminars

A slide deck is a rhetorical object. That sentence sounds obvious only after you say it. In practice, academics usually treat decks as containers: containers for equations, tables, figures, bullet points, proofs, citations, robustness checks, and reminders to ourselves about what to say next. We rarely talk about the deck as an instrument of persuasion, and when we do, we often reduce persuasion to superficial advice: fewer words, bigger fonts, nicer colors.

That misses the deeper structure. A deck is not merely a visual aid. It is a staged encounter between a speaker, an audience, and an argument. The speaker wants the audience to leave changed in some way: understanding a theorem, believing an empirical claim, seeing a research design as credible, accepting a limitation as manageable, or feeling the importance of a problem. That is rhetoric.

Aristotle's *Rhetoric* remains useful because it gives us a compact vocabulary for this encounter. He divides the speaker's own means of persuasion into three kinds: **ethos**, **pathos**, and **logos**. These are often translated casually as credibility, emotion, and logic. That translation is not wrong, but it is too thin. In Aristotle, each term has a technical role in persuasion.

- **Ethos** is persuasion through the character of the speaker as revealed in the speech.
- **Pathos** is persuasion through the emotional condition of the audience.
- **Logos** is persuasion through argument, especially enthymeme and example.

Academic decks need all three. A research seminar that contains only logos becomes a hostile data dump. A lecture that contains only pathos becomes inspirational noise. A polished deck without ethos looks like consulting theater. The craft is not choosing one mode of persuasion. The craft is balancing them for the audience and occasion.

This essay explains the three Aristotelian appeals and applies them to two academic settings: **classrooms** and **research seminars**. The two settings share the same rhetorical foundations, but the balance differs. Students need orientation, pacing, repetition, and confidence. Peers need credibility, identification, evidence, and a clear account of what would make the claim fail.

## Decks Are Performance, Not Documents

The starting point is that a deck is not a paper. A paper can be reread. A paper can carry footnotes, qualifications, long definitions, and parallel arguments. A deck is experienced in time. The audience receives each slide once, in sequence, while also listening to the speaker. They cannot pause you, scroll back freely, or reread a dense paragraph until it clicks.

That makes the deck a performance medium. The slide is not the speech. The slide is a visual anchor for the speech. It focuses attention, names the claim, displays the proof object, and gives the audience something to remember.

The rhetorical question is therefore not "Does this slide contain the information?" The question is "What does this slide make possible in the room?"

For a classroom, a slide may make possible a step in a proof, a moment of shared discovery, or a safe place for students to re-enter the argument after getting lost.

For a research seminar, a slide may make possible trust in the design, clarity about the identifying variation, or a precise confrontation with the strongest objection.

Aristotle helps because he reminds us that persuasion is not just the presence of evidence. Persuasion depends on who is speaking, how the audience is disposed, and how the argument is structured.

## The Three Artistic Proofs

Aristotle distinguishes between proofs that exist outside the speaker's craft and proofs created by the speaker's craft. External proofs include contracts, witness testimony, laws, documents, or data that exist independently of the speech. In academic work, external proofs include the dataset, the regression output, the paper being cited, the theorem, the institutional fact, the preregistration, or the code archive.

But external proofs do not persuade by themselves. A regression table sitting on a slide is not yet an argument. A theorem written in full is not yet understanding. A dataset does not explain its own relevance. The speaker must select, arrange, interpret, and stage the material.

That staging is where Aristotle's three artistic proofs matter.

## Ethos: Character Made Visible

Ethos is often summarized as credibility, but Aristotle's meaning is more specific. Ethos is not simply reputation imported from outside the room. It is the speaker's character as revealed through the speech itself. The audience asks, often silently: should I trust this person's judgment?

Aristotle says persuasive ethos depends on three qualities:

1. **Phronesis**: practical wisdom or good judgment.
2. **Arete**: virtue, excellence, or seriousness of character.
3. **Eunoia**: goodwill toward the audience.

These map cleanly onto academic presentations.

**Phronesis** means the audience believes you know how to reason in this domain. You understand the methods, the tradeoffs, the failure modes, and the relevant alternatives. You do not merely know facts; you show judgment about which facts matter.

**Arete** means the audience believes you are serious. You are not cutting corners. You are not hiding inconvenient results. You are trying to get the truth, not merely win the room.

**Eunoia** means the audience believes you are acting with goodwill toward them. You respect their time. You understand what they need. You are not trying to overwhelm them, humiliate them, or manipulate them.

### Aristotle's Example

In *Rhetoric*, Aristotle argues that we believe fair-minded people more readily and more completely, especially in matters where certainty is unavailable. This is not because character replaces evidence. It is because character affects how the audience evaluates uncertain evidence. A speaker who appears practically wise, virtuous, and well-disposed toward the audience receives more trust when the question cannot be settled mechanically.

That is the normal condition of academic work. Most research presentations involve uncertainty: measurement choices, model assumptions, external validity, omitted mechanisms, alternative interpretations, or finite-sample evidence. Ethos is what lets an audience follow you through uncertainty without concluding that you are either naive or selling something.

### Ethos in Research Seminar Decks

In a research seminar, ethos is established by demonstrating that you know the terrain and have stress-tested your own claim.

Ethos appears in slides that do the following:

- State the research question without exaggeration.
- Put the identification strategy early.
- Show the source of variation plainly.
- Acknowledge the strongest threat to identification.
- Explain why a tempting alternative design was not used.
- Admit where the evidence is weaker.
- Present a robustness check as a diagnostic, not as a decorative appendix.
- Include a "skeptic would say" slide before the audience has to say it for you.

The most important ethos move in a seminar is not polish. It is honest control over the argument. You build trust when you show the audience that you know where the bodies could be buried and have looked there yourself.

Bad seminar ethos looks like this:

- "Here are my results" before the audience understands the design.
- A dense table with no explanation of what identifies the coefficient.
- A slide that says "robustness checks" with twenty estimates and no diagnosis.
- A conclusion that outruns the design.
- A refusal to acknowledge the obvious limitation.

Good seminar ethos looks like this:

- "The design works only if this comparison is credible."
- "The strongest objection is differential pre-trends in treated counties."
- "This placebo does not prove the design, but it rules out the most mechanical version of the objection."
- "I cannot distinguish these two mechanisms with the current data."

Those sentences build trust because they show phronesis, arete, and eunoia at once.

### Ethos in Classroom Decks

In a classroom, ethos works differently. Students are not primarily judging whether your new empirical claim deserves publication. They are judging whether they are safe following you through a difficult idea.

Classroom ethos is built by showing command and care.

Command means the teacher understands the material deeply enough to simplify it without distorting it. Care means the teacher remembers that the audience is encountering the material for the first time.

Ethos appears in slides that do the following:

- Name where students are in the argument.
- Use notation consistently.
- Introduce objects before manipulating them.
- Separate conceptual steps across slides.
- Give worked examples.
- Repeat the key idea at transitions.
- Signal what is essential and what is optional.

Bad classroom ethos looks like a professor proving mastery by moving too fast. Good classroom ethos looks like a professor proving mastery by making the path visible.

The student should feel: "This person knows where we are going, knows where I might get lost, and has built the slides to help me recover."

That is eunoia. It is not softness. It is rhetorical competence.

## Pathos: The Audience's State of Mind

Pathos is often mistranslated as "emotion" in a way that makes academics suspicious. We imagine sentimental manipulation or motivational speaking. Aristotle means something more precise. Pathos concerns the audience's emotional condition because judgment changes with emotional condition.

People do not evaluate an argument the same way when they are afraid, bored, angry, ashamed, curious, confused, confident, or hopeful. Aristotle analyzes emotions not as irrational noise but as structured states involving beliefs about the world. Fear, for example, arises when a destructive or painful future seems near and plausible. Confidence arises when safety or resources seem available. Anger arises when someone perceives a slight. Pity arises when undeserved suffering seems near to someone like us.

The presenter who ignores pathos is not being rational. The presenter is ignoring the conditions under which rational attention becomes possible.

### Aristotle's Example

Aristotle's discussion of fear is especially useful. Fear is a painful disturbance caused by the imagination of a future destructive evil. To make an audience afraid, a speaker makes the danger seem serious, near, and plausible. To make an audience confident, a speaker shows resources, allies, distance from danger, or a path of action.

This is exactly how many academic presentations should begin. The opening should establish a tension the audience recognizes. Something is wrong, missing, puzzling, costly, or misunderstood. Then the speaker gives the audience a path through it.

Pathos is not saying "this is important" in large red letters. Pathos is making the audience feel the problem as their problem.

### Pathos in Research Seminar Decks

Research seminars often underuse pathos because academics fear looking unserious. The result is the default bad opening:

- "This paper studies..."
- "The literature on..."
- "Today I will present..."
- "Here is my outline..."

These openings do not create tension. They ask the audience to care before giving them a reason.

Seminar pathos should usually be intellectual rather than sentimental. The emotion you want may be curiosity, surprise, discomfort, or recognition.

Good seminar pathos might begin with:

- A fact that should not be true.
- A policy decision made under uncertainty.
- A common empirical practice that quietly changes the estimand.
- A finding that appears robust until one assumption moves.
- A literature split that cannot be explained by theory alone.

The goal is to make the audience think: "I see the problem. I want to know how this resolves."

Pathos also matters in how you handle threats and limitations. If the room is skeptical, pretending there is no problem increases hostility. Naming the anxiety lowers it. A slide titled "The obvious worry is selection" can calm a room because it shows you are not hiding from the issue.

In a seminar, pathos often works through relief. The speaker raises a legitimate concern, then shows how the design addresses it. The audience feels the tension and the release.

### Pathos in Classroom Decks

In classrooms, pathos is even more important because students often experience difficult material emotionally before they experience it logically.

They may feel:

- Confused.
- Embarrassed that others seem to understand.
- Anxious about math.
- Bored because the stakes are unclear.
- Overconfident because the notation looks familiar.
- Defeated after losing one step in a derivation.

A good teaching deck manages these states.

Classroom pathos appears in slides that:

- Begin with a concrete problem students can recognize.
- Tell students when a step is difficult.
- Use signposts like "This is the only trick."
- Include pauses and recap slides.
- Make the first example simple enough to create confidence.
- Show why the abstraction is worth learning.

A student who feels lost stops processing. A student who feels oriented can tolerate difficulty. Therefore the emotional function of a teaching deck is not entertainment. It is maintaining the conditions for attention.

This is why teaching decks may need more explicit structure than seminar decks. A roadmap slide may be dead weight in a 25-minute research talk but valuable in a 75-minute lecture. A recap slide may be redundant for peers but essential for students. Repetition is not inefficiency when the goal is learning.

## Logos: Argument, Enthymeme, and Example

Logos is persuasion through argument. In Aristotle, the central form of rhetorical argument is the **enthymeme**, often described as a rhetorical syllogism. An enthymeme is not always a formal syllogism written out in full. It is an argument that relies on premises the audience can supply.

The other major form is the **example**, which reasons from cases. Examples are especially important when the audience needs to see a pattern rather than a deduction.

Academic audiences often think they already privilege logos. In one sense, they do: research is full of evidence, models, equations, and identification claims. But a deck can contain a great deal of logical material without making a clear argument.

Logos in a deck is not the quantity of information. Logos is the visible structure of inference.

### Aristotle's Example

Aristotle gives examples of reasoning from signs, probabilities, and cases. A speaker might argue that a person who asks for a bodyguard is aiming at tyranny because previous tyrants asked for bodyguards. The example does not prove the claim with mathematical certainty. It gives the audience a pattern and invites the inference.

That is close to how much empirical presentation works. We show a pre-trend graph, a placebo, a balance table, or a sensitivity plot. Each is a proof object. But the audience needs to know what inference the object supports.

The slide title should name that inference.

Not:

> Event study

But:

> Treated and control counties moved together before the law

Not:

> Robustness checks

But:

> The estimate survives every bandwidth except the one with no first stage

The title is the enthymeme's conclusion. The figure is the evidence. The spoken words supply the missing premises.

### Logos in Research Seminar Decks

In a seminar, logos means the audience can reconstruct the argument:

1. What is the question?
2. What would answer it?
3. What variation is used?
4. What identifying assumption is required?
5. What evidence supports that assumption?
6. What is estimated?
7. What does the estimate mean?
8. What does it not mean?

The deck should make this chain visible. If the chain is hidden, the audience will create its own, often less charitable version.

Logos appears in:

- Assertion titles.
- Clean diagrams of timing, treatment, and comparison groups.
- One equation per conceptual step.
- Figures that answer one question.
- Tables that isolate one comparison.
- Transitions that explain why the next slide follows.

The most common logos failure in seminars is the regression-table dump. A table with seven columns and forty coefficients may contain the evidence, but it does not present the argument. It asks the audience to do your rhetorical work while also listening to you speak.

The better approach is to stage the inference:

- First show the design.
- Then show the main estimate.
- Then show the identifying threat.
- Then show the diagnostic.
- Then show the robustness that matters.

Each slide should carry one inferential step.

### Logos in Classroom Decks

In a classroom, logos is not just proof. It is learnable sequence.

Students need to see how each step follows from the previous step. This means a teaching deck may violate the superficial version of "compression" while obeying the deeper version. A proof spread over six slides can be more rhetorically efficient than the same proof compressed onto one slide because it lowers cognitive cost.

Classroom logos appears in:

- Step numbers.
- Definitions before applications.
- Notation reminders.
- Worked examples.
- Visual analogies.
- Recap slides.
- Contrasts between wrong and right interpretations.

For students, the slide title should often name the conceptual move:

- "Independence lets us multiply probabilities."
- "Conditioning changes the denominator."
- "OLS finds the line that makes residuals orthogonal to regressors."
- "Parallel trends is an assumption about the untreated potential outcome."

These are not labels. They are claims students can carry forward.

The teacher's spoken explanation then supplies the intuition, the example, and the warning.

## How the Appeals Differ by Audience

The same deck principles apply to classrooms and seminars, but the weights differ.

### Classroom

The classroom audience is usually less expert than the speaker and more vulnerable to confusion. The central rhetorical challenge is not skepticism but orientation.

In classrooms:

- **Ethos** means "I can guide you safely through this."
- **Pathos** means "You can learn this; the difficulty is manageable."
- **Logos** means "Each step follows, and you can see why."

The teacher should usually emphasize pathos and logos more than in a seminar. Students need emotional permission to struggle and a clear sequence to follow. Ethos is built through clarity, pacing, and care.

Good classroom decks:

- Use more signposting.
- Use more repetition.
- Use more worked examples.
- Introduce notation slowly.
- Put fewer objects on each slide.
- Use titles that state the lesson of the slide.

The classroom deck should make students feel that the instructor has anticipated their confusion.

### Research Seminar

The research seminar audience is more expert and more skeptical. The central rhetorical challenge is not orientation alone but credibility under uncertainty.

In seminars:

- **Ethos** means "I know the literature, the method, and the threats."
- **Pathos** means "This problem matters, and the tension is real."
- **Logos** means "The evidence supports this claim under clearly stated assumptions."

The seminar deck should emphasize ethos and logos, with pathos used to establish stakes and maintain attention. A seminar audience will punish unsupported emotion, but they still need a reason to care.

Good seminar decks:

- Lead with the question and stakes.
- Identify the source of variation early.
- Use assertion titles.
- Show one proof object per slide.
- Include the strongest objection.
- Separate main evidence from appendix material.
- End with one memorable claim, not "Questions?"

The seminar deck should make peers feel that the speaker has disciplined the argument before asking them to believe it.

## The Deck Title as Argument

The practical bridge between Aristotle and slide design is the assertion title.

If ethos, pathos, and logos are working, the slide title should reveal it.

An ethos-building title:

> The identifying assumption fails if treated counties were already diverging

This shows the speaker knows the threat.

A pathos-building title:

> The result looks stable until one hidden implementation choice changes

This creates tension.

A logos-building title:

> Standardizing the covariate restores agreement across all six packages

This states the inference.

Weak titles hide the argument:

- Background
- Motivation
- Methods
- Results
- Robustness
- Discussion

Strong titles carry the argument:

- The policy changed at different times across otherwise similar counties
- Treated counties do not trend differently before adoption
- The estimate doubles when already-treated units enter the comparison group
- The literature review overstates what three cited papers actually show

If someone reads only the titles of a deck, they should understand the spine of the talk. This is logos as structure, ethos as control, and pathos as pacing.

## The Devil's Advocate as Ethos, Pathos, and Logos

The "Devil's Advocate" slide is one of the most powerful academic slides because it activates all three appeals.

It builds **ethos** because it shows you have anticipated the critique.

It manages **pathos** because it lowers the audience's anxiety that you are hiding something.

It strengthens **logos** because it clarifies the condition under which your argument would fail.

The format is simple:

> A skeptic would say...

Then state the strongest objection in its strongest form.

Not a weak objection. Not a straw man. The real one.

For a seminar:

> A skeptic would say treated counties were already on different trajectories.

For a classroom:

> The tempting mistake is to treat independence and mutual exclusivity as the same thing.

For an AI-and-research talk:

> A skeptic would say AI hallucinates, so why trust it with verification?

Then answer. Or concede the residual risk. Either move is better than pretending the objection does not exist.

## Common Failures Through the Aristotelian Lens

### Failure of Ethos: The Speaker Does Not Seem Trustworthy

This happens when the deck overclaims, hides limitations, or looks like the speaker has not thought about obvious objections.

Symptoms:

- No identification slide.
- No limitations.
- Robustness as decoration.
- Citations used vaguely.
- Claims stronger than evidence.

Fix:

- Add the strongest objection.
- Show what would break the claim.
- Acknowledge what cannot be answered.
- State the inferential limits clearly.

### Failure of Pathos: The Audience Does Not Care or Cannot Stay With You

This happens when the deck begins with labels, definitions, literature lists, or administrative throat-clearing.

Symptoms:

- Agenda slide with many items.
- "Today I will talk about..."
- Motivation that only says the topic is important.
- No tension.
- No recognition of audience anxiety or confusion.

Fix:

- Start with a problem the audience recognizes.
- Name the anxiety.
- Show the stakes.
- Create a puzzle.
- Give the audience a reason to want the next slide.

### Failure of Logos: The Argument Is Not Visible

This happens when evidence appears without a clear inferential role.

Symptoms:

- Dense tables.
- Figures with label titles.
- Multiple ideas per slide.
- No transition logic.
- Results before design.

Fix:

- Turn titles into claims.
- Use one proof object per slide.
- Stage the inference.
- Make the key comparison visually dominant.
- Move secondary evidence to backup.

## Designing a Classroom Deck

A classroom deck should be built around the student's path from not knowing to knowing.

Start with:

1. What problem motivates the concept?
2. What prior intuition can students use?
3. What new object must be defined?
4. What is the first simple example?
5. What is the common mistake?
6. What should they remember?

For ethos, the deck should signal that the instructor is in control and cares about comprehension.

For pathos, the deck should reduce fear and sustain curiosity.

For logos, the deck should make each step visible.

A good classroom sequence might be:

1. A concrete puzzle.
2. A visual intuition.
3. A definition.
4. A worked example.
5. The common wrong interpretation.
6. The corrected interpretation.
7. A recap.
8. A slightly harder application.

The classroom deck can be slower than a seminar deck. That is not a defect. The audience and purpose differ.

## Designing a Research Seminar Deck

A research seminar deck should be built around the audience's path from skeptical attention to disciplined belief.

Start with:

1. What is the question?
2. Why should this audience care?
3. What is the empirical challenge?
4. What variation addresses it?
5. What is the main estimate?
6. What is the strongest objection?
7. What evidence addresses the objection?
8. What remains uncertain?

For ethos, the deck should show judgment and seriousness.

For pathos, the deck should make the puzzle matter.

For logos, the deck should make the inferential chain visible.

A good seminar sequence might be:

1. A puzzling fact or policy stakes slide.
2. The research question as a claim.
3. A simple design diagram.
4. The identifying assumption.
5. The main estimate.
6. The strongest threat.
7. Evidence against the threat.
8. Mechanism or heterogeneity.
9. What the paper contributes.
10. The final takeaway.

The seminar deck should not be a paper in slide form. It should be a guided tour through the argument's spine.

## AI, Decks, and the New Verification Problem

AI tools make deck production cheaper. They can read a paper, extract the argument, generate a draft deck, create figures, and iterate on design. This changes the production frontier.

But cheaper production does not remove rhetoric. It raises the importance of verification.

The questions become:

- Did the agent identify the real argument?
- Did it preserve the paper's claims accurately?
- Did it invent a narrative that is prettier than the evidence?
- Did it create slides that serve speech or slides that merely look polished?
- Did it manage ethos, pathos, and logos for the actual audience?

The same Aristotelian frame becomes an audit frame.

Ethos audit:

- Does the deck make the speaker look practically wise, serious, and well-disposed toward the audience?
- Does it acknowledge limitations?
- Does it avoid overclaiming?

Pathos audit:

- Does the deck begin from a problem the audience recognizes?
- Does it manage anxiety, confusion, or skepticism?
- Does it give the audience a reason to care?

Logos audit:

- Can the argument be read from the slide titles?
- Does each slide have one inferential role?
- Does each figure or table prove one claim?

AI can help produce the deck. It can also help audit the deck. But the final judgment remains human because rhetoric depends on the real audience, the real room, and the speaker's actual purpose.

## Conclusion

Academic decks are not neutral containers for information. They are rhetorical instruments.

Aristotle's three appeals give us a durable framework:

- **Ethos**: make the speaker's judgment and goodwill visible.
- **Pathos**: meet the audience in the emotional state that determines attention.
- **Logos**: stage the argument so the inference can be followed.

In a classroom, these appeals help students stay oriented, confident, and able to learn.

In a research seminar, they help peers see the stakes, trust the design, and evaluate the evidence.

The best decks do not merely look good. They make persuasion, teaching, and verification possible.

That is the rhetoric of decks.
